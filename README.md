## Zaid Al Lahham

I am a junior software developer looking to carve out a career for myself in this dynamic industry. Earning a BSc in Engineering & Business (2:1) at Warwick University allowed me to acquire and hone a wide range of skills and garnered in me a renewed appreciation for the way software and technology drive development across the wider industrial and sectoral landscape. Upon graduation, I joined a highly selective software development bootcamp, Makers Academy, where I learned how to craft clean, well tested software while pair programming and working in an Agile manner.  

## Skills
