## Zaid Al Lahham

I am a fullstack software engineer looking to carve out a career for myself in this dynamic industry. Earning a BSc in Engineering & Business at Warwick University allowed me to acquire and hone a wide range of skills and garnered in me a renewed appreciation for the way software and technology drive development across the wider industrial and sectoral landscape. Upon graduation, I joined Makers Academy, where I learned how to craft clean, well tested software while pair programming and working in an agile manner. This ultimately lead me to work in one of the best SaaS companies in the MENA region, BoundlessHR, where I introduced TDD and other industry leading methodologies as part of the stack. I am now undertaking the next challenge in my career as a postgraduate student, where I will be focusing on supplementing my experience in the industry with the academic offerings at UCL.

My varied experience, both academic and non-academic have made me highly adaptable and a quick learner that keenly tackles new challenges and opportunities.
